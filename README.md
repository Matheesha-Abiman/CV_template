## 🧩 Section-by-Section Customization

### 1️⃣ Header
Update your name, designation, and professional links. The template uses **FontAwesome** icons for a modern look.
> **Tip:** Ensure your LinkedIn and GitHub links are clickable using the `\href` command.

### 2️⃣ Summary
Write a 2-3 sentence "elevator pitch." Focus on your core technologies and what value you bring to a team.

### 3️⃣ Skills
The skills are grouped by category (Languages, Tools, Databases). 
> **Tip:** Keep this section high-level. Only list tools you are comfortable discussing in an interview.

### 4️⃣ Experience & Projects
This is the most important part. Use the **Action-Result** formula:
* ❌ *Bad:* "I made a billing app using React."
* ✅ *Good:* "Architected a React-based billing system that reduced manual processing time by 40%."

## ✅ ATS-Friendly Features
This template is specifically designed to pass through **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**:
* **No Tables or Columns:** Complex layouts often break ATS scanners.
* **Standard Headings:** Uses common keywords that scanners look for.
* **Text-Based:** Since it's compiled from LaTeX, the text is perfectly selectable and readable by machines.

## 💡 Quick Tips
* **Quantify Results:** Use numbers (%, $, #) to show your impact.
